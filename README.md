Remix js was chosen as a main tool. Mongo+Prisma orm for database. Tailwind for styling

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
